      "feature_id": 1,
      "title": "Phase 1A: Project Foundation & Configuration",
      "objective": "Establish the project's technical foundation for browser-based crawling by adding Playwright as an optional dependency, automating its setup, and implementing a validated Pydantic configuration model for all browser settings."
